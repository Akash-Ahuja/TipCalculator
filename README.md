# TipCalculator

This is a project that I worked on as the prework for the codepath iOS development course.

In this project, the task was to build a tip calculator app that lets the user enter the billing amount and calculates the tip, and the total amount given the various percentages of the tips provided to the user!

Along with the tip calculations, few features were added to it. These include the dark/night mode as well as the reset button which takes the user back to entering the billing amount everytime a user finishes filling in his credentials! Along with the reset button, the entered bill amount shifts to the nearest whole number when resetting before going back to 0 (2 step process). For instance, lets say the bill amount is $50.88, so when we reset it, it will first go to $51 and then to $0. In addition, I also made a feedback label and a text field where users can leave comments about their experience and any improvements/concerns that the user has regarding the whole system.
